# Frogger
Frogger videogame powered by Javascript

##HTML5 with Javascript
I combined the use of Javascript with HTML5 to make a game for browser using the new canvas technology included in HTML5. The game engine I 
used was used before to make a Galaga type game. I modified the engine to allow me to create a completly new game based on Frogger.

##Running the game
To run the game must download all the files by cloning the project to a local repository or by downloading the zip of 
this project. Once you have downloaded the project, open the **.html** in your favourite browser (tested on _**Google Chrome**_, 
_**Mozilla Firefox**_ and _**Internet Explorer**_).
